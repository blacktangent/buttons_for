ActiveView helper to generate Bootstrap buttons and dropdown-buttons.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'buttons_for'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install buttons_for

Run generator to add I18n locales:

    $ rails generate buttons_for:install

The gem depends on [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) to create buttons and dropdown-buttons. Bring bootstrap into
your project by using [Bootstrap for Sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) or you preferred method.

`buttons_for` depends on [Font Awesome][fontawesome] icon and CSS
framework, bring [Font Awesome][fontawesome] into your project using
[font-awesome-rails][fontawesomerails] or your preferred method.

## Usage

`buttons_for` has multiple helper methods. The API is intentionally made
quite simple and does not support url generation or any advanced
functionallity. It's just ment as a thin wrapper around `link_to` and
should pass the options transparently.

The helpers you'll use the most provide buttons with a color and a
leading icon. The following standard buttons can be used: `new`, `edit`,
`delete` and `export`. These buttons are just wrappers around the `button` helper
giving it options containing icon and button class.

`buttons_for` also provides a helper for creating dropdown buttons. Use
`dropdown` with a block containing `link` elements to achive this.

Example show button menu:

```erb
<%= buttons_for do |b| %>
  <%= b.dropdown :actions do %>
    <%= b.link "Projects", company_projects_path(@company), icon: "list" %>
  <% end %>
  <%= b.button t(".lock"), lock_company_path(@company), icon: "lock", class: "btn-default" %>
  <%= b.edit edit_company_path(@company) %>
  <%= b.delete company_path(@company) %>
<% end %>
</div>
```

Example index button menu:

```erb
<%= buttons_for do |b| %>
  <%= b.new url_for(action: :new) %>
  <%= b.export url_for(format: :csv) %>
<% end %>
```

## Options

Available options:

* __:label__ - Override standard label.
* __:class__ - Appendse given string to existing CSS classes.
* __:icon__  - Prefix or replace exsiting icon.

## Translations

The installer copies the file `buttons_for.en.yml` into your
`config/locales/` directory. Add a corresponding file with your own
locale to translate the buttons.
